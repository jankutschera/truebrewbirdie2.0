          <p>Some say that nothing lasts forever</p>
          <p>But no one knows what happens when you die</p>
          <p>So if this is all there is, it's now or never</p>
          <p>Life's too short to not give it a try…</p>

          <p>Some say that nothing lasts forever</p>
          <p>But no one knows what happens when you die</p>
          <p>So if this is all there is, it's now or never</p>
          <p>Life's too short to not give it a try</p>
          <p>So try your wings, find out if you can fly, yeah</p>
          <br>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time on creating something true</p>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot</p>
          <br>
          <p>I've spent my last three years in college</p>
          <p>As the oldest guy there, I got my degree</p>
          <p>And I guess it all gave me some kind of knowledge</p>
          <p>But anyway I'm still just as naive</p>
          <p>Hoping greener grass' still waiting there for me</p>
          <br>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time on creating something true</p>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot</p>
          <br>
          <p>It's not about the size of any wallet (true brew we call it)</p>
          <p>It's not about the fortune or the fame (that's not our aim)</p>
          <p>True brew is what we'd like to call it</p>
          <p>It's a freedom both scary and lovely, you want all the same</p>
          <p>True brew will always be the aim</p>
          <br>
          <p>I just want to live for something true</p>
          <p>I don't care if it's good enough for you</p>
          <p>I just wanna create something true</p>
          <br>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time on creating something true</p>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not</p>
          <p>I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot</p>
          <br>
          <p>'Cause it's my true brew (I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do)</p>
          <p>This is my true brew, yeah (I just wanna spend my time on creating something true)</p>
          <p>This is what I do (I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not)</p>
          <p>What I like to do (I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot)</p>
          <p>Don't care if it's good enough for you</p>
