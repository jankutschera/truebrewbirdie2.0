          <p>Some say that nothing lasts forever<br>But no one knows what happens when you die<br>So if this is all there is, it's now or never<br>Life's too short to not give it a try<br>So try your wings, find out if you can fly, yeah</p>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do<br>I just wanna spend my time on creating something true<br>I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not<br>I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot</p>
          <p>I've spent my last three years in college<br>As the oldest guy there, I got my degree<br>And I guess it all gave me some kind of knowledge<br>But anyway I'm still just as naive<br>Hoping greener grass' still waiting there for me</p>

          <p>It's not about the size of any wallet (true brew we call it)<br>It's not about the fortune or the fame (that's not our aim)<br>True brew is what we'd like to call it<br>It's a freedom both scary and lovely, you want all the same<br>True brew will always be the aim</p>
          <p>I just want to live for something true<br>I don't care if it's good enough for you<br>I just wanna create something true</p>
          <p>I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do<br>I just wanna spend my time on creating something true<br>I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not<br>I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot</p>
          <p>'Cause it's my true brew (I don't wanna live my life doing stuff I don't like to do)<br>This is my true brew, yeah (I just wanna spend my time on creating something true)<br>This is what I do (I don't wanna live my life just pretending what I'm not)<br>What I like to do (I just wanna spend my time living my life on the spot)<br>Don't care if it's good enough for you</p>
